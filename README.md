The Square Game is a project in C for Arduino Uno Rev3 board. 
I used PlatformIO, a CLI tool (or IDE extension), for building the project, doing serial port monitor testing, and installing dependencies like the C libraries with definitions for the microcontroller registers. 
The Arduino Uno Rev3 is equipped with a Multi-function Shield Expansion which utilises a buzzer, 4 buttons, a potentiometer, 4 LEDs and a 4 digits 7 segments LED display.

##### To play the game on the Arduino that's equiped with the Whadda WPSH209 Shield Expansion, open the project in an IDE and use either the PlatformIO CLI or Extention to download the dependencies, build the project and upload it to the Arduino. The PlatformIO extention will read the platformio.ini file when downloading dependencies.

The C program makes use of pointers, efficient memory allocation, communication with hardware components, writing directly to pins, created libraries with my own custom methods.
